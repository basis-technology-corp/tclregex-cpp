=========================================================
 Differences between Tcl/Tk Regular Expressions and PCRE 
=========================================================

* Lookbehind assertions:
   - Tcl REs do not support positive/negative lookbehind assertions.

* Metasyntax:
   - Flags (i.e. "(?x)") apply throughout the expression no matter
      where they appear.

* Conditional matches:
   - Tcl REs do not support conditional matches.
      i.e. (?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)

* Character classes/properties:
   - Tcl supports the full Unicode locale, meaning the standard POSIX
      character classes ([:alpha:], etc.) are extended over all Unicode 
      characters.
   - Tcl does not support matching characters by character properties
      (i.e. \p{} and \P{}).

* Recursive patterns:
   - Tcl does not support recursive patterns.

* Syntax:
   - '\b' for word boundary is replaced by '\y'.
   - '\m' and '\M' match only beginnings and ends of words respectively.

For more specific details on Tcl RE syntax refer to the Tcl "re_syntax"
manual page (http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/re_syntax.htm).

In the version of the TCL regexp engine used here the following
character classes have been implemented to replace the lack of support
for character properties:

Unicode properties: Cc Cf Co Cs Ll Lm Lo Lt Lu Mc Me Mn Nd Nl No Pc Pd
Pe Pf Pi Po Ps Sc Sk Sm So Zl Zp Zs 

Unicode scripts: Arabic Armenian Bengali Bopomofo Braille Buginese
Buhid Canadian_Aboriginal Cherokee Common Coptic Cyrillic Devanagari
Ethiopic Georgian Glagolitic Greek Gujarati Gurmukhi Han Hangul
Hanunoo Hebrew Hiragana Inherited Kannada Katakana Khmer Lao Latin
Limbu Malayalam Mongolian Myanmar New_Tai_Lue Ogham Oriya Runic
Sinhala Syloti_Nagri Syriac Tagalog Tagbanwa Tai_Le Tamil Telugu
Thaana Thai Tibetan Tifinagh Yi

These can be used in the same manner as the POSIX character class. For
example: "[[:Hiragana:]]" or "[[:Zs:]]" would match a single Hiragana
character or whitespace character respectively.
