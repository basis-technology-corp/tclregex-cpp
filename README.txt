Porting work was done by Reilly Grant.

(These breadcrumbs left after the fact, by joelb.)

The original source comes from:

  The third is the "Tcl library". This was added to Tcl version 8.1 and
  supports wide-character Unicode. Although Spencer intended to release
  this library as a standalone package [ref: Usenet], I don't think he
  ever got around to it. However, Thomas Lackner has produced a version
  of the files from Tcl 8.5a3 that compiles on BSD and Linux: see his
  hsre page.

I've unpacked the original source to:
  //depot/third-party-tools/hsre-0.1/...
